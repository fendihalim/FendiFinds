Growing up in an Asian household and communities (Indonesia), rice cookers are must have things in every kitchen. Even when I went to study abroad in the US, one of the first thing I purchased was a rice cooker. It is very convenient, plug your machine, put your rice, put your water, and click cook.

But then I noticed that majority of rice cookers use Teflon material which I avoid because they easily scratched and it can leech to our body. Therefore, I changed my rice cooking method to stove-top because all of my kitchen utensils are stainless steel. The ratio is 1 part of rice to approximately 1 part of water.

Here is the guideline on making the perfect steamed white rice (Thai Hom Mali Jasmine Rice).

### Tools

- Heavy bottomed STAINLESS STEEL POT
- Measuring cup (½ Cup)

### Ingredients

- 1 Part of Rice
- ~1 Part of Water

### Instructions

1. Put 1 cup of rice to the pot
2. Wash and rinse the rice for 2 to 3 times and then drain.
3. Put 1 cup of water to the pot (not fully 1 cup, just slightly less than 1 cup)
4. Cover the pot and then put on the stovetop
5. Turn on the burner to intensity of 3.5 / 10
6. About 6 minutes in, there should be little bubbles in the middle of and around the rice. This is the indicator to turn the stoe to all the way down ( 1 / 10)
7. Set a timer for 20 minutes. 
8. Turn off the stove and let sit for 5 minutes.
9. Enjoy.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 3: The reason for slightly less water is that some water remains from rinsing the rice.  
- Step 5: Stoves have different intensity settings. The heat should be about medium-low, similar to a fire just before medium heat.  
- Step 6: Different pots and stoves cook differently. Around 6 minutes is usually the mark to check for little bubbles in the middle and around the rice.  
- Steps 3 & 7: After cooking, if the rice is too soft, use slightly less water or cook a bit longer (21–22 minutes). If too hard, use slightly more water or reduce the cooking time (20 minutes or less).
