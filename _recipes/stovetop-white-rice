Growing up in an Asian household and communities (Indonesia), rice cookers are must have things in every kitchen. Even when I went to study abroad in the US, one of the first thing I purchased was a rice cooker. It is very convenient, plug your machine, put your rice, put your water, and click cook.
But then I noticed that majority of rice cookers use Teflon material which I avoid because they easily scratched and it can leech to our body. Therefore, I changed my rice cooking method to stove-top because all of my kitchen utensils are stainless steel. The ratio is 1 part of rice to approximately 1 part of water.
Here is the guideline on making the perfect steamed white rice (Thai Hom Mali Jasmine Rice).

### Tools
- Heavy bottomed STAINLESS STEEL POT
- Measuring cup (Â½ Cup)

### Ingredients
- 1 Part of Rice
- ~1 Part of Water

### Instructions
1. Put 1 cup of rice to the pot
2. Wash and rinse the rice for 2 to 3 times and then drain.
3. Put 1 cup of water to the pot (not fully 1 cup, just slightly less than 1 cup)
4. Cover the pot and then put on the stovetop
5. Turn on the burner to intensity of 3.5 / 10
6. About 6 minutes in, there should be little bubbles in the middle of and around the rice. This is the indicator to turn the stoe to all the way down ( 1 / 10)
7. Set a timer for 20 minutes. 
8. Turn off the stove and let sit for 5 minutes.
9. Enjoy.

### Troubleshooting:
- Step 3: The reason for this is because there would be some water left from rinsing the rice
- Step 5: Stoves have different intensity and settings. The heat should be the intensity of a fire about to go to the medium heat.
- Step 6: Different pot and differen stove have different intensity. I find that 6 minutes is usually the mark to check on your rice.
- Step 3 & 7: After enjoying your rice, if it's too soft, use less water or cook longer (21-22 minutes). If it's too hard, use more water or keep it at 20 minutes or less
