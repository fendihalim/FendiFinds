Growing up in an Asian household and community in Indonesia, rice cookers were a must-have in every kitchen. Even when I went to study abroad in the US, one of the first things I purchased was a rice cooker. They are very convenient: just plug in the machine, add rice, add water, and click cook.

However, I noticed that most rice cookers use Teflon, which I avoid because it scratches easily and can leach chemicals into our food. Therefore, I switched to stove-top cooking since all of my kitchen utensils are stainless steel. The ratio I use is 1 part rice to approximately 1 part water.

Here is my guideline for making perfect steamed white rice (Thai Hom Mali Jasmine Rice).

### Tools

- Heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot
- Measuring cup (½ Cup)

### Ingredients

- 1 Part Rice
- ~1 Part Water

### Instructions

1. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot.
2. Wash and rinse the rice 2 times, then drain.
3. Add 1 cup of water to the pot (slightly less than a full cup).
4. Cover the pot and place it on the stovetop.
5. Turn on the burner to medium-low intensity (about 3.5 / 10).
6. After about 6 minutes, small bubbles should appear in the middle and around the rice. This indicates it’s time to lower the heat to the lowest setting (1 / 10).
7. Set a timer for 20 minutes.
8. Turn off the stove and let the rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes.
9. Enjoy.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 3: Slightly less water is used because some water remains from rinsing the rice.
- Step 5: Stoves vary in intensity. The heat should be about medium-low, similar to a fire just below medium heat.  
- Step 6: Different pots and stoves cook differently. Around 6 minutes is usually the mark to check for small bubbles in the middle and around the rice.  
- Steps 3 & 7: If the rice is too soft, use slightly less water or cook a bit longer (21–22 minutes). If too hard, use slightly more water or reduce cooking time (20 minutes or less).
