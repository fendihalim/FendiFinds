This is a simple guide to buying a stainless steel pot.

I’m writing this guide to highlight the importance of choosing healthy cooking tools for home cooking.  

Dr. Rhonda Patrick has discussed microplastics in food and cooking utensils, and she suggests switching to stainless steel, cast iron, or ceramic.  

Dr. Yvonne Burkart has also written about the dangers of PFAS on her blog.  

**TL;DR:** Avoid plastic and non-stick materials. Use stainless steel, cast iron, carbon steel, or full ceramic.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Stainless Steel Pots

1. **Choose fully-clad pots over disc-bottomed pots.** Disc-bottomed pots are generally cheaper because they are easier to make, but their quality is lower. Fully-clad pots, on the other hand, are thicker, tougher, and conduct heat more evenly. They will last much longer.  
2. **Knock on the bottom of the pot.** It shouldn’t sound hollow.  
3. **Check the thickness and layers.** Get at least 3-ply pots (stainless steel - aluminum - stainless steel), which is the ideal configuration.  
4. **Don’t forget the lid!**  

### Recommended Brands

1. All-Clad  
2. Calphalon (make sure it’s fully-clad)  
3. Kirkland  
4. Fissler  

Here is the pot I use for cooking rice.
